I'm flattered you want to know more about me :)
I attended Mississippi State Unviersity for seven semesters, majoring in software engineering and mathematics. I finished my SE degree and began working in industry for Camgian. I have plans to return to school in the future to finish my mathematics major and possible pursue a masters or Ph.D. in Computer Science.
