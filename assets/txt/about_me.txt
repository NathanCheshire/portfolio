Currently
I am working in industry as a Software Engineer developing CUAS solutions. At some point I hope to return to school to finish my mathematics major and possibly pursue a masters or Ph.D. in computer science.
Before University
Before choosing MSU as my college choice, I graduated from highschool after having been homschooled through all of grade school due to having ADHD and dyslexia. During my junior year, I decided to take my first and only AP course, AP computer science. This was my first exposure to programming. Learning Java in AP computer science gave me both my extreme bias towards Java and the desire to choose software enginereing as a career path.
